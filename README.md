Current Steps 
 	Collect and preprocess data: To train the chatbot, you will need a dataset of alcoholic drink recipes and user reviews. There are various online sources for this data, such as cocktail recipe websites and online review platforms. Once you have collected the data, you will need to preprocess it by cleaning and formatting it for use in the chatbot.
 	Choose a PyTorch model: There are various PyTorch models that can be used for building chatbots, such as sequence-to-sequence models and transformer models. You will need to choose a model that is suited to the specific requirements of your chatbot.
 	Train the model: Once you have chosen a model, you will need to train it using the preprocessed dataset. This involves dividing the data into training, validation, and testing sets, and using PyTorch to train the model on the training set.
 	Implement the chatbot: Once the model is trained, you will need to implement the chatbot using a Python-based framework for building chatbots, such as Flask or Django. This involves integrating the model with a user interface that allows users to interact with the chatbot and receive recommendations for alcoholic drinks.
 	Test and refine the chatbot: After implementing the chatbot, you will need to test it to ensure that it works correctly and meets the requirements of the project. You may need to refine the chatbot by tweaking the model or adding new features based on user feedback.
